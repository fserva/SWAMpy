# Bootstrapping Scripts for Sambuca and Bioopti
## Windows Versions

These scripts streamline the creation of Anaconda environments with the package
versions required by Sambuca and Bioopti.

To use:

1. Make sure you have installed Anaconda.
2. Run bootstrap_64bit.cmd

Remember to activate the environment prior to working on or running the model.
You do this by issuing the command `activate inundation` in a Windows Command
Prompt. PyCharm can also be configured to use the correct Python environment.
